Sam Jentsch is a Houston based photographer with an intrinsic interest in the city and how it is evolving. His current project documents the city and the surrounding areas connected through the extensive bayou system. This work focuses on the natural environments existing along the bayou, the communities that have developed alongside it, and the industries that have taken advantage of it. Through documentary landscapes and poetic imagery, his projects provide a record of the impact on this ecosystem and the people that live within it.
